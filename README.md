# ADMIXTURE_MAPPING_PIPELINE
This pipeline is an extension to Alicia Martin's ancestry pipeline that includes two-way and three-way admixture mapping. 
Found here https://github.com/armartin/ancestry_pipeline

This pipeline will achieve the following
1. Phasing using SHAPEIT
2. Convert SHAPEIT output into RFMIX input
3. Perform local ancestry inference using RFMIX
4. Perform admixture mapping
